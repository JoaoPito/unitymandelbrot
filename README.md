# unitymandelbrot
Just a simple and crude Mandelbrot Set Image Generator.

That classical Mandelbrot Set project that anyone interested in math and programming does.
It simply creates a image of the mandelbrot set (without any zoom, panning, etc unless you tweak the numbers in the editor).

Actually I did not put much effort into this, I used it to learn more about complex numbers.
